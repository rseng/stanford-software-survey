# List any software that is created or managed by your group or lab?

## 2020

<p class="team team-summary team-summary-large">This is only a small sample of the open source software developed by Stanford researchers! Very likely there are still cultural challenges to sharing, meaning that a lab or individual won't share due to fears about being "scooped." If you look closely, you'll see that some labs have their own GitHub organization, and other software is developed under the name of an individual. Click on any box to be taken to a page for the software.</p>
